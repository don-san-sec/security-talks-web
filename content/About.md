# Security Talks Digest
Every year, hundreds of security conferences happen globally, where thousands of engineers share their experiences, findings, projects, and more. Although, materials from these conferences are generously shared with the wide audience, most of this stuff remains overlooked by the community.

This project seeks to aggregate materials from the security conferences around the world and deliver them in form of a weekly report.  
It will never be a better time to cancel Netflix.

## How reports are constructed?
### Selection criteria
Security talks are collected from more than 250 Security conferences around the world.
To be included in the digest, a talk must meet the following criteria:
- It must be presented in English,
- It must be conducted in 2023 or later,
- Its video must be released on the Youtube starting from Week 07 of 2024.

### Categorisation
To make _skimming_ throught the digest easier it is split into sections by a domain of the Information Security. Talks that span multiple domains are placed in a section that fits the best (or more specifically).
Breakdown into domains is subjective and may change over time.
<details>
  <summary>Current breakdown is the following</summary>

- Application Security
  - Secure Coding Practices
  - Authentication and Authorization
  - Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment
  - Security Testing and Auditing
- Security Operations
  - Incident Response and Forensics (includes Reverse Engineering)
  - Threat Detection
  - Threat Intelligence
  - Security Architecture and Tooling
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Offensive Security
  - Penetration Testing (includes Red Teaming)
  - Exploit Development
  - Malware Development
  - Wireless Security
  - Physical Security
  - Security Research often used for Vulnerability Discovery.
  - Social Engineering
- Emerging Technology Security
  - AI Security
  - Blockchain Security
  - IoT Security
  - VR/AR Security
- Governance, Risk, and Compliance
- Cloud Security
- Cryptography
- Data Privacy
- Hardware Security
- Career Development
- Soft Skills
</details>

_Do not agree with the breakdown? Let me know in the [Issue](https://github.com/don-san-sec/security-talks/issues)._

### Summarisation
Is the talk worth an hour of your time? A summary is one way to determine that. Summaries are derived from descriptions on the conference website, the YouTube video description, or transcriptions of the talk. The generalization process involves an AI agent, but the final result is always proofread.

### Tagging
Tagging is another way to condense a talk into a bit of information that helps in navigating through the digest. Each talk can have up to three tags. Tags are arbitrary and are not chosen from a limited or predefined set.
